# Kaplong-Chepsir-Elevation-Cross-section
This is a study repository for the placement of radio station transmitters and receivers

## Proposition
The initial plan was to place a SDL at Location A(Kaplong), and transmitters either at Chepsir or Chebewor.

## Why these locations?
Location A is the physial location of the radio station.
For the SDL to transmit waves to the transmitters, there must be a straight lime of view, without obstacles (hills, mountains, buildings).
Trasmitters must also be at a higher ground for maximum wave coverage.

## Task
- Obtain a cross-section of Location A - Chepsir
- Obtain a cross section of Location A - Chebewor

### Workflow
Softwares used:
  - Google Earth Pro
  - ArcGIS ArcMap
The folowing workflow was implemented:
  - Zoom in to the location area in Google Earth
  - Digitize points randomly in the locations
  - Draw a straight line of sight from location A to the transmitter locations
